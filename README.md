Lab work for course related to algorithms in 4th semester of B.Tech. - CSE in IIIT Vadodara.

-----
Lab 1 :-

P1: To implement direct addressing.

P2: To implement hashing with chaining.

P3: To implement hashing using probing.

P4: To implement
  a) queue using two stacks.
  b) stack using two queues.

P5:
  a) Change the sequence of elements in a given queue/stack to any desired permutation using two additional queue/stack respectively.
  b) To sort elements of queue/stack using two additional queue/stack respectively.
  
P6: To implement a list data structure which behaves as a queue if its size is less than 9 and as a stack otherwise.

P7: Solving tower of hanoi.


-----
Lab 2 :-

P3:
  a) To implement standard merge sort.
  b) To implement scan, divide into maximal monotonically increasing subarray, merge variant of merge sort.

P5: To find rank of any element in O(log N) worst time:
  Given an array indexed 1 to n. Smallest element at index k. Subarrays 1:k-1 and k:n are monotonically increasing.
